# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It covers the fundamental concepts of OOP, including:

- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the blueprint for creating objects and how to instantiate them.
- **Attributes and Methods**: Defining the properties and behaviors of objects.
- **Inheritance**: Creating subclasses that inherit from parent classes, promoting code reuse.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to certain attributes and methods for better data integrity and security.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, enhancing flexibility.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Classes and Objects
- Classes serve as blueprints for objects, defining their attributes and methods.
- Objects are instances of classes that hold specific data.

### 2. Inheritance
- Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass).
- Promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

### 3. Encapsulation
- Restricts access to certain attributes and methods, making them private.
- Uses getter and setter methods for controlled access to private data.

### 4. Polymorphism
- Enables different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they follow a common interface.
- Promotes flexibility and simplifies function calls.

## Usage
To explore the concepts of OOP in Python, clone this repository and examine the code examples provided. You can run the scripts in your local Python environment to see how OOP works in practice.
